Hey there, {author}! It looks like you're trying to use the !propose command, but something's not quite right with the syntax. No worries though, I've got you covered.

Here's how the command should look: `!propose @username amount reason`

- `@username`: the person you'd like to reward with points.
- `amount`: how many points you'd like to give.
- `reason`: a short explanation of why you're giving the grant. This message will be posted if the grant is applied.

Here are some examples to get you started:
`!propose @Cinderella 100 for saving the kingdom from the dragon`
`!propose @PrinceCharming 200 for taming the wild unicorn and bringing peace to the land`

Don't worry, we all make mistakes, just give it another try! To learn more in DM, type `!help-lazy`. And if you're still having trouble, feel free to reach out for help.

Listen up, my elite friend! This bot is for the exclusive use of the Layer 3 squad. It's like a secret handshake for making quick and easy decisions. Want to know more about it? Check out our top secret files on {GITHUB_PROJECT_URL}. But shhh, don't tell anyone else about it! ü§´

Hey there, are you ready to shake things up? Look no further, because the !propose command is here to save the day! üéÜ

Here's how it works:

- Type anywhere: `!propose @username amount reason`. For example:
> !propose @JohnDoe 100 bucks for pizza party

- Your proposal will be sent straight to the `#L3-Voting` channel for all to see. And don't worry, you don't have to lift a finger after that - just make sure you explained your proposal clearly and let the magic happen! ü¶•

- After {int(GRANT_PROPOSAL_TIMER_SECONDS / 60)} hours, if there's less than {LAZY_CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD} dissenters, BAM! The grant is automatically applied. üöÄ I will keep you all updated.

- If you disagree to any proposal, add the {CANCEL_EMOJI_UNICODE} reaction to it in #L3-Voting. Don't worry, you can change your mind later (unless it's too late). Bonus points if you tell us why you're against it! ‚è±Ô∏è

- Also, if you change your mind regarding your own proposal, just add {CANCEL_EMOJI_UNICODE} to it in #L3-Voting and poof! It's gone. Magic! üé©

So, don't be shy and get those creative juices flowing! Let's make Eco the best it can be with some fresh ideas! üåü

I'll just leave this here for contributors and the curious: {GITHUB_PROJECT_URL}
