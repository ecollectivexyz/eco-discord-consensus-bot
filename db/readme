Both ini files are set up correctly.

================
Initialization
================

1) For each DB, the working directory should be initialised (this will also create alembic.ini script):

alembic init alembic-main

2) Then add to the generated env.py the Base import from the schema - this enables metadata connection:

import path
import sys

# directory reach
directory = path.Path(__file__).abspath()
# setting path
sys.path.append(directory.parent.parent.parent)

from bot.config.schemas import Base

3) Also in env.py initialize the metadata:

target_metadata = Base.metadata


==========
Migration
==========

1) First, generate a migration script, e.g. for main DB:

alembic -c alembic-consensus-bot.ini revision --autogenerate -m "Add new column to Proposals"

2) SQLite has limited support for altering tables, which is why you're encountering the NotImplementedError. To work around this limitation, Alembic provides a "batch mode" that creates a new table with the desired schema, copies the data from the old table to the new one, and then renames the new table to the original name.

To use the batch mode, you'll need to update your migration file. Locate the generated migration
file in the db/alembic-main/versions directory, and give it to chatgpt asking to update for sqlite.
To do this the reliable way, give it old schemas of each table you need to update (run for each: sqlite3 > .schema
voters), and the relevant declarations of the same ORM classes, then it works well.

3) Once you've updated the migration scripts, run the patch:

alembic -c alembic-consensus-bot.ini upgrade head


Notes:

If you see: ERROR [alembic.util.messaging] Target database is not up to date.
Remove files under versions/ and generate then again ("migration" step 1).
