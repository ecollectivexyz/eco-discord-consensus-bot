Both ini files are set up correctly.

1) First, generate a migration script, e.g. for main DB:

alembic -c alembic-consensus-bot.ini revision --autogenerate -m "Add new column to Proposals"

2) SQLite has limited support for altering tables, which is why you're encountering the NotImplementedError. To work around this limitation, Alembic provides a "batch mode" that creates a new table with the desired schema, copies the data from the old table to the new one, and then renames the new table to the original name.

To use the batch mode, you'll need to update your migration file. Locate the generated migration file in the db/alembic-main/versions directory, and give it to chatgpt asking to update for sqlite. 

3) Once you've updated the migration scripts, run the patch:

alembic -c alembic-consensus-bot.ini upgrade head
