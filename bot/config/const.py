Hey there, {author}! It looks like you're trying to use the !propose command, but something's not quite right with the syntax. No worries though, I've got you covered.

Here's how the command should look: `!propose @username amount reason`

- `@username`: the person you'd like to reward with points.
- `amount`: how many points you'd like to give.
- `reason`: a short explanation of why you're giving the grant. This message will be posted if the grant is applied.

Here are some examples to get you started:
`!propose @Cinderella 100 for saving the kingdom from the dragon`
`!propose @PrinceCharming 200 for taming the wild unicorn and bringing peace to the land`

Don't worry, we all make mistakes, just give it another try! To learn more in DM, type `!help-lazy`. And if you're still having trouble, feel free to reach out for help.

Unfortunately, you don't have a Layer 3 role which is needed to use Consensus bot on Eco server.

The bot is an open-source project under MIT license. Contributions are welcome! See "Contributing" section on GitHub if you're interested.

Also looking for teammates! If you possess expertise in Python and are excited about the project, please don't hesitate to reach out {RESPONSIBLE_MENTION}. Also looking for a QA automation engineer onboard.

Hey there, are you ready to shake things up? Look no further, because the !propose command is here to save the day! üéÜ

Here's how it works:

- Need a grant? Type anywhere: `!propose @username amount reason`. For example:
> !propose @JohnSnow 100 for saving the kingdom

- Have an idea but don't need a grant? Type whatever you want after "!propose":
> !propose to run a community meeting tonight at 20 UTC

- Your proposal will be sent straight to the `#l3-voting` channel for all to see. And don't worry, you don't have to lift a finger after that - just make sure you explained your proposal clearly and let the magic happen! ü¶•

- After {int(PROPOSAL_DURATION_SECONDS / 60 / 60)} hours, if there's less than {LAZY_CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD_NEGATIVE} dissenters, BAM! You've got the green light. If you requested a grant, it will be automatically applied. üöÄ I will keep you all updated.

- If you disagree to any proposal, add the {EMOJI_VOTING_NO} reaction to it in `#l3-voting`. Don't worry, you can change your mind later (unless it's too late). Bonus points if you tell us why you're against it! ‚è±Ô∏è

- Also, if you change your mind regarding your own proposal, just add {EMOJI_VOTING_NO} to it in `#l3-voting` and poof! It's gone. Magic! üé©

Before submitting a proposal, make sure to explain the background and details of it. Use the lazy consensus responsibly. *Clearly state what actions will be taken if the proposal is approved.* Avoid vague descriptions, and submit proposals in the appropriate channel (e.g. the channel of your activity or #l3-season-1-activities). The bot will create a post in #l3-voting once you send a proposal.

So, don't be shy and get those creative juices flowing! Let's make Eco the best it can be with some fresh ideas! üåü

For power users:
- Some shortcuts of `!propose` are: {", ".join(PROPOSAL_COMMAND_ALIASES)}.
- Run `!export` to receive analytics.

For questions, ideas or partnership, reach out to {RESPONSIBLE_MENTION}. The project is looking for contributors and teammates: {GITHUB_PROJECT_URL}
